All targets within Close range must succeed on a Finesse Reaction Roll or mark 3 Stress. 5. Stunning Clap: The Box leaps and their sides clap, creating a concussive boom. All targets within Very Close range must succeed on a Strength Reaction Roll or become Vulnerable until the cube is defeated. 6.
